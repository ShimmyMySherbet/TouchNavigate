# Touch Navigate
A Firefox extension that adds touch screen swipe navigation to navigate back and forth. Designed for navigation with 2-in-1 laptops in tablet mode. 

This extension only works with the touch screen, not trackpads.

Similar to gesture navigation on Android devices.

This extension is still early on in development. It is experimental, but operational.
